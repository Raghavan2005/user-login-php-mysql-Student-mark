Download the latest version of XAMPP from the Apache Friends website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install XAMPP on your computer.

Once the installation is complete, start the XAMPP Control Panel.

Start the Apache and MySQL modules by clicking on the "Start" button next to each of them.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/. This will open the phpMyAdmin interface, which you can use to manage your MySQL databases.

Click on the "New" button in the left sidebar to create a new database.

Enter a name for your database and click on the "Create" button.

Once your database has been created, go to the "Import" tab and select the PHP file you want to upload.

Click on the "Go" button to upload the PHP file to your database.

You can now access your PHP file by going to http://localhost/your_php_file.php, where "your_php_file.php" is the name of your PHP file.


The SQL query "select * from login where username = '$username' and password = '$password'" is used to retrieve all the columns (using the "*" symbol) from the "login" table where the "username" column matches the value of the $username variable and the "password" column matches the value of the $password variable.

This query is typically used in a login system where the user enters their username and password, and the system checks if they match the values stored in the "login" table. If a row is returned, it means that the user has entered valid credentials and can be authenticated.
